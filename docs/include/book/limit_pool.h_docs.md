 *  thus p2 will be able to use the CS as many times as it likes while p1 stays in remainder
 *
 *  no starvation:

 *  a) choosing[2] == 1, but for p2 to enter the cs, choosing[2] has to equal 0, thus p1 would not block on the first spin
 *  b) if p1 were to block on the second spin, that means num[2] < num[1], p2 got assigned a lower number
 *  however, once p2 enters and leaves the cs, it sets num[2] to 0
 *  if p2 were to continue, it would get assigned a higher num value than p1, since we take the max of all assigned nums so far,
 *  so now num[1] < num[2], and this time, p1 will be able to enter the cs, with p2 spinning on the second while loop
 *
 *  no deadlock:
 *  2 processes p1 and p2
 *  say both processes enter the bakery at the same time
 *  even if the computed num[i] is the same, the process with a lower id will be able to enter the cs
 *  if one process did not compute a number yet, the other will also be able to enter the cs
 *  there is no case where both processes will be stuck in the entry section
